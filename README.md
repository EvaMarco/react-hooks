# Course react hooks by Platzi.

This repo has been build during the course "Professional React Hooks" by
platzi. It represents a simple a desk of characters get from an api.

In this repo I'm trying to learn the use of different kinds of hooks and its
uses.

## Â¿What would you find in this project?

In this project, you will find a bunch of cards of "Ricky and Morty" characters.
In each card you will find some interesting information about the character.
You would save your favorites characters in a top bar.

Also you can adjust dark or light mode.
